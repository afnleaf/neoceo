AI firm CEOs keep making statements about how AI will come in and be so distruptive and take everyone's jobs. Especially yours, and you should be worried about it. Well I don't care, this is just capital trying to remove labour from the equation as is in their material interest. 

So, why not try to replace the CEO role with AI? It's probably better. I can pretend to be a plumber and connect stuff together if they don't work. You don't need to pay money to use AI tools like cursor, claude code, codex, etc. You just need a few emails and a few free accounts to access these LLMs. Use the chat interface. 

## goal
Have an AI act as the founder of a tech startup with the goal of making a product or service that can be sold.
